"""Simple MMS (memory management system) simulation.

Some general notes:

"Page" means always "virtual page number".  We do not track physical
page numbers in this class, because we do not need to.

When performing "read" operations, we do not really read anything.  We
just pretend to do so.  Read the method documentation for details on
what is really done.

We do not provide a write() function here.  Thus, "to swap out" means
removing a page from memory, not necessarily writing it to disk."""
